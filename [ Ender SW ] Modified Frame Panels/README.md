# Modified frame panels for Ender SW (Voron Switchwire) conversion

This is a remix of original frame panel files from [Boubounokefalos original repo](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW).

— Additional 3mm bottom cutouts added, while laving 5mm perimeter height and 5mm perimeter frame. Benefits — cuts print time to almost half, the same is for amount of filament used while keeping structural integrity for panels good enough to serve without issues in long run.

— Voron logo on front panels (invisible from top) just to keep some connection with brand. Serves no practical purpose (your prints will not get better or worse) but gives you a warm fuzzy feling :)
