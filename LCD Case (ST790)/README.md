# LCD case mod for standard ST790 display

This is a remix and polishment of multiple awesome mods in strive to create near perfect case mod for standard stock ST790 display used for Ender 3 and series as well as multiple other budget FDM printers, modded or stock.

Mostly meant for [Ender SW conversions] (https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW) if anyone decided to go budget path and do not use Mini 12864 Display recommended by official BOM or just want to make any printer with stock ST790 display better looking.

My personal reason for creating this was that I literally hate the lack of any aesthetics for any Creality ST790 display cases for older printer version with all my heart.

# Works used as basis and inspiration of this remix

— Heavily moded [Spool holder base] (https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW/blob/main/STL/spool_holder_base.stl) from [boubounokefalos Ender SW repo] (https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW);

— Hardly and carefully improved case files from [Gizzle's repo] (https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire)
